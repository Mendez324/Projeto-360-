Projeto 360ยบ (Yorn)

This project was created during classes, and it simulates network page of the client Yorn, it was made in an agency like environment with UX, marketing and project managing students, i was the only frontend.

So i made a landing page similar to the rest of Yorn's site ( A slider type site) and used the js plugin Fullpage because i had 1 week to do it, and my exprience is not that extense. Also using js made a burguer menu when the site reached mobile resolution.
